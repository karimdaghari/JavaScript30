# 🤓 Intro
While my initial focus is on bettering my understanding of (front-end) JS (and consequentially honing my skills), at the same time I'm also interested in applying my Git learning. So, this is my first bite at it, at GitHub *and* at Markdown.

# 🌠 Objectives
- [x] Start 👍
- [x] Getting Started: **9/30** projects done by ~~30/05~~ **27/05**  🥉💪
- [x] Halfway there: **15/30** projects done by ~~**2/06**~~ **31/05** 🥈💪
- [ ] ~~Finish all the mini-projects by **10/06** 🥇🎉~~
- [ ] ~~Stretch Goal: Finish by **7/06** 🏆🔥~~

### ❗️️ ️Update
Due to time constraints and (positive) change of circumstances, I decided to:
1. Postpone the remaining objectives
2. Do projects I deem to be worthy by **01/06**

# ✍️ Notes
Included below are links to bullet points of new stuff **I** learned from each project. (WIP)

1. [Drum Kit](/01%20-%20Drum%20Kit/readme.md) ✅
   *  ` data-{whatever}`: Create user-defined attributes
   *  `transitionend` event: Fired when a CSS transition has completed
   *  `classList`: Returns all classes attached to element
   *  `<audio>`: `audio.currentTime` and `audio.play()`
2. [JS and CSS Clock](/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock/readme.md) ✅
   * `selector.style.cssAttribute = value`: Directly set `cssAttribute`'s value
   * A *method* cannot be passed as a parameter in JS
3. [CSS Variables](/03%20-%20CSS%20Variables/readme.md) ✅
   * CSS Variables: `--varName: value;` (Declaration) and `var(--varName);` (Usage)
   * The diff between `NodeList` and `Array`: More methods
   * Short-circuit evaluation
   * `Document.documentElement`: Always returns `<html>` element
4. [Array Cardio Day 1](/04%20-%20Array%20Cardio%20Day%201/readme.md) ✅
   * One-liner arrow functions have an implicit `return`
   * ⚠️ Always put an `initial` value in a `reduce` function: to avoid headaches
5. [Flex Panel Gallery](/05%20-%20Flex%20Panel%20Gallery/readme.md) ✅
   * The `this` you're thinking of should probably be inside a regular function
6. [Type Ahead](/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead/readme.md) ✅
   * The spread operator `...`: *spreads* over an iterable object (i.e: string, array and object)
7. [Array Cardio Day 2](/07%20-%20Array%20Cardio%20Day%202/readme.md) ✅
   * `every` is the opposite of `some`
8. [Fun with HTML5 Canvas](/08%20-%20Fun%20with%20HTML5%20Canvas/readme.md) ✅

    * Basically there are two main methods:
      * `localStorage.setItem()`: adds item to localStorage
